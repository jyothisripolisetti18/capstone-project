PSCS106-Encryption Of Biometric Traits To Avoid Privacy Attacks

PROBLEM STATEMENT-Encryption of multimodal features enhances the security for physical characters of biometrics. Bio-crypto system provides the 
authentication as well as the confidentiality of the data. This project proposes to improve the security of multimodal systems by 
generating the biometric key from iris and face biometrics with its feature extraction using machine learning techniques. The 
secret value is encrypted with biometric key using symmetric Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Algorithm which is efficient 
in terms of software implementation and works well on the image data.
